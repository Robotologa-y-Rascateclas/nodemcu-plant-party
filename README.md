NodeMCU Plant Party
===================

This is a project to monitor the health of your plants and watering them when
necessary, using a NodeMCU, a Capacity Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2, and several
other things that we will document later.

It will also send the data to a server and display it in a web page.
